# An introduction to Hydrological Modelling with python

Hydrological models are used to simulate streamflow, soil moisture, groundwater and other hydrological processes, and can be useful for understanding and predicting how hydrological systems work. The python language is well suited to hydrological data analysis and plotting, but also can be very powerful for building hydrological models. Python is open source, so can be freely obtained, and run on any computer operating system. In this seminar I will introduce students to the python language, demonstrate how to build a very simple hydrological model, and demonstrate how to run/calibrate a model sophisticated hydrological model. I will share the scripts and data with students afterwards so they can run the model on their own computers.

In this repo are included the models that were used in this webinar, as well as the lecture notes.
